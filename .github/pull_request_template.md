Hello there! Thank you for considering a pull request for PHP Monitor. 

Please read the text below first before you submit your PR.

## Keep this in mind!

- Some code changes available to the sponsor repository may not be pushed to the public repository yet, so it's common that the public repository is a little behind.
- Because of this, it is usually best to *get in touch first* if you are making substantial changes. 
- Low effort changes may not be accepted.
- When in doubt, open an issue or discussion and ask me if it's worth doing something.

## About destination branches

Please keep in mind that `main` is reserved for the current code state of the latest release and should generally *not* be the destination branch unless a new release is happening. 

**Pull requests that target `main` will usually be retargeted.**

Usually, the best target is the stable `dev/x.x` branch that corresponds with the latest major version that is released, although that branch may not be available or up-to-date at all times.

There may be a newer branch available, which is an appropriate place for bigger changes, but please keep in mind that it is usually best to announce you‘ll be working on such a change before you spend the time, since as the lead contributor I might not even want said change in the app.

Thank you.
