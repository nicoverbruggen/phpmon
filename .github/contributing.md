# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PHP Monitor!

While the code of the latest PHP Monitor release is public, many things are constantly in flux that may not be pushed to this repository yet. 

In particular, certain changes may only be available to [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nicoverbruggen) via the [EAP repository](https://github.com/phpmon/early-access).

Please consider creating an issue before working on anything related to the project, so that I can confirm you are not just wasting your time.

**Making any changes in a fork and opening a pull request WITHOUT properly documenting your changes and referencing an issue may require me to close your PR.**

To repeat, I am not opposed to small contributions and fixes, if they are meaningful or insightful, but low effort changes are generally not accepted.

To learn more, please check out the [pull request template](/.github/pull_request_template.md) which contains more information about my contribution requirements. (This will also show up when you open a new PR.)

Thank you for respecting this!
