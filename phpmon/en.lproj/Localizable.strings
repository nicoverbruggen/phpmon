• PHP: If you are seeing an error status, there may be an issue with PHP's configuration. Make sure the .ini files in the Homebrew installation are OK, and there are no socket conflicts.

• nginx: If you are seeing an error status, a site is likely misconfigured (usually noted in the error log). You will likely want to check Valet's nginx folder.

• dnsmasq: If you are seeing an error status, the dnsmasq configuration file is likely broken (usually located at ~/.config/valet/dnsmasq.d).";
